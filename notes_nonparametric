Non-parametric statistics do not assume that the data or population have any characteristic structure (e.g., distributions etc.,).

Try Wilcoxon (non-parametric) dependent, signed-rank test in-lieu of previous t-tests.

Why - because we cannot assume a normal distribution - check histogram

Wilcoxan Null Hypothesis is that: The 'median' difference between pairs = 0
